The doubly linked list reverse() method we are writing is supposed to use the pointer to the HEAD as a starting point, and traverse through our doubly-linked-list and reverse the order of the list.

For Example, given an array [1, 2, 3, 4], it would start at 1, then traverse through the array and switch it to [4, 3, 2, 1] by reversing the node properties of .next and .prev to the appropriate values.
